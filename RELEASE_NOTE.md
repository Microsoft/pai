# OpenPAI Release Note

## May 2020 (version 1.0.0)

With the v1.0.0 release, OpenPAI is officially switching to pure Kubernetes-based architecture. In addition to this, we had also made efforts on making our component design more modularized by re-organized the code structure to 1 main repo together with 7 standalone key component repos.

Please refer to the [system architecture](https://github.com/microsoft/pai/blob/master/docs/system_architecture.md) documentation for more detailed design thinkings about this change, and review the following list to get a better understanding about the 7 new component repos:

  - [hivedscheduler](https://github.com/microsoft/hivedscheduler) is a new OpenPAI component providing various advantages over standard k8s scheduler, such as resource isolation for multiple tenants, GPU topology guarantee for virtual clusters, and better topology-aware gang scheduling with no [resource starvation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starvation_(computer_science)).
  - [frameworkcontroller](https://github.com/microsoft/frameworkcontroller) is built to orchestrate all kinds of applications on Kubernetes by a single controller.
  - [openpai-protocol](https://github.com/microsoft/openpai-protocol) is the specification of OpenPAI job protocol. It facilitates platform interoperability and job portability. A job described by the protocol can run on different clusters managed by OpenPAI. The protocol also enables great flexibility. Any AI workload can be described by it conveniently.
  - [openpai-runtime](https://github.com/microsoft/openpai-runtime) provides runtime support which is necessary for the OpenPAI protocol. OpenPAI runtime can classify typical runtime error patterns and prevent unnecessay error retries. Therefore cluster resource can be saved.
  - [openpaisdk](https://github.com/microsoft/openpaisdk) is a JavaScript SDK designed to facilitate the developers of OpenPAI to offer more user-friendly experience.
  - [openpaimarketplace](https://github.com/microsoft/openpaimarketplace) is a service which stores examples and job templates. Users can use it from webportal plugin to share their jobs or run-and-learn others' sharing job.

    Features:

    1. Provide a way for team collaboration among pai users.
    2. Provide an easy-to-start and education for new users. Users could refer to shared templates in marketplace and learn how to use pai platform correct.
    3. Provide admin review process to ensure the quality of templates in marketplace.

  - [openpaivscode](https://github.com/microsoft/openpaivscode) is a VSCode extension, which makes users connect OpenPAI clusters, submit AI jobs, simulate jobs locally and manage files in VSCode easily.

The version of each standalone repo used in OpenPAI `v1.0.0` is hivedscheduler `v0.3.2`, frameworkcontroller `v0.6.0`, openpai-protocol `v2.0.0-alpha`, openpai-runtime `v0.1.0`, openpaisdk `v0.1.0`, openpaimarketplace `v1.2.0` and openpaivscode `v0.3.0`.

Other major new features and improvements come with this new release are:

  - Based on [kubespray](https://github.com/microsoft/pai/tree/master/contrib/kubespray), we provided a [quick start script](https://github.com/microsoft/pai/blob/master/contrib/kubespray/doc/quick-start.md) for you to deploy OpenPAI from scratch faster.
  - In addition to basic authentication, [support for Azure Active Directory (AAD)](https://github.com/microsoft/pai/blob/master/docs/aad-e2e/aad-e2e.md) was added to provide SSO and multi-factor authentication for users.
  - [Built-in storage](https://github.com/microsoft/pai/blob/master/docs/setup-persistent-volumes-on-pai.md) were refactored to support more storage types with a unified interface.
  - [Storage manager](https://github.com/microsoft/pai/tree/master/src/storage-manager) is provided for users to set up NFS+SMB storage server easily.
  - [Webportal UX is upgraded to Microsoft Fluent UI 7.0](https://github.com/microsoft/pai/issues/4024). UI component and style elements are optimized to provide more user-friendly experience for both user and admin scenarios.
  - [RESTful API has been refined](https://github.com/microsoft/pai/issues/4337) to be cleaner and more well-organized. [A detailed swagger document](https://redocly.github.io/redoc/?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microsoft/pai/master/src/rest-server/docs/swagger.yaml) is also provided.
  - In addition to current documentation, we provide [an end-to-end usage manual](https://openpai.readthedocs.io/) for cluster users and administrators to learn how to use OpenPAI.
