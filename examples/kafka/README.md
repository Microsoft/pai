## How to run kafka on PAI
If you just want to make a very simple example to see whether you can use kafka on PAI, you could submit the job with the kafka.json file in this folder. Then, you can see the stdout in the "Go to Tracking Page" page. You could see that the program has already produced and consumed message with kafka. 

And we have prepared a docker image with zookeeper, kafka and kafka-python for you, you can use it by building image with the "Dockerfile.example.kafka" file:`sudo docker build -f Dockerfile.example.kafka -t kafka.test .`. And then "run" and "exec" it!

But, if you want to use kafka by yourself, you should follow the next steps.

Please follow the next processes step by step. Do not skip any steps if you don't know whether you can skip them.

### Zookeeper
If you already have a kafka cluster, you could skip this step. And if you build the image by "Dockerfile.example.kafka", you should do the work of step 2 and ignore the others.

1. [Download zookeeper source file](https://zookeeper.apache.org/doc/r3.1.2/zookeeperStarted.html) and unpack it.

2. Change the name of file "/conf/zoo_sample.cfg" to "/conf/zoo.cfg" and open it.

3. Set the "dataDir" and "clientPort" like "dataDir=/var/zookeeper clientPort=XXXX". Remember the port you set.

4. Start it `bin/zkServer.sh start`.

### Kafka
If you already have a kafka cluster or build the image by "Dockerfile.example.kafka", you could skip this step.

Just take reference in the [official document](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/apache_kafka/apache_kafka_installation_steps.html).

Note:

1. You should set the listeners in config/server.properties:"listeners=PLAINTEXT://localhost:XXXX". The port "XXXX" is the kafka client port you should use in your client code. But you'd better use dynamic port rather than static port due to possible conflict. The way of using dynamic port is described at the end of this document.

2. The "zookeeper.connect" port is the port you have already set in "/conf/zoo.cfg".

3. If you can't start the kafka server, it might because you haven't started the zookeeper server or you haven't set the correct port.

### Make your logical code
1. If you want to use python to check if the kafka can be used correctly, you'd better see the [official document](https://kafka-python.readthedocs.io/en/master/). Don't forget to install kafka-python.(If you build the image by "Dockerfile.example.kafka", ignore it!)

2. When you use the producer of kafka, you should keep in mind that the massage might be lost if you haven't set "acks" and haven't use "producer.flush()".

3. When you use the consumer of kafka, you should notice that you might be not able to consumer the message if you don't set "auto_offset_reset" to "earliest" even though you produce the message after you starting the consumer.

4. Make a shell file to start all the servers and programs.

### Submit Job
If you could use kafka correctly in your own environment, of course computer or server, you could:

1. build the environment into a docker image.

2. push it into a public registry.

3. submit your job on PAI webportal.

Note:
Now(2018-6-26), we can't use static port and dynamic port at the same time, and the job would add two dynamic ports(ssh and http) automatically. So, we could only use dynamic port to support zookeeper and kafka instead of static port. Then the way to use dynamic port is following:

1. Delete the port setting sentences in "zoo.cfg" and "server.properties".

2. Add the sentences you have deleted by using command "sed" and environment variable:

`sed -i "13a clientPort=$PAI_CONTAINER_HOST_zookeeper_PORT_LIST" zoo.cfg`

`sed -i "123a zookeeper.connect=localhost:$PAI_CONTAINER_HOST_zookeeper_PORT_LIST" server.properties`

`sed -i "31a listeners=PLAINTEXT://localhost:$PAI_CONTAINER_HOST_kafka_PORT_LIST" server.properties`

3. Delete the port setting codes in your logic codes.

4. Add the deleted codes by the same way as you doing with the sentences.

5. Make sure you have already put these sed commands in your shell file.

6. Submit your job again!
