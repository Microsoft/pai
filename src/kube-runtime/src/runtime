# To run runtime scripts under runtime.d in task container,
# execute them here in priority order.
# Here're the steps to onboard a new runtime script,
# 1. put it under runtime.d
# 2. give it a priority in [0, 100] and insert below in order
# 3. add the following format block

# comment for the script purpose
# priority=value
# ${PAI_RUNTIME_DIR}/runtime.sh >> ${PAI_RUNTIME_LOG_FILE} 2>&1


# export runtime env variables
# priority=0
source ${PAI_RUNTIME_DIR}/runtime_env.sh
