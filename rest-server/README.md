# AII RESTful API Server

RESTful API Server is built as an interface for the system, which allows you to submit, monitor or abort deep learning jobs.


## Quick Start

1. Write Job Config File

    Prepare a job config file as described in [examples/README.md](../examples/README.md#config-file), for example, `exampleJob.json`.

2. Submit the Job

    HTTP PUT the config file as json to:
    ```
    http://restserver/api/job/exampleJob
    ```
    For example, with [curl](https://curl.haxx.se/), you can execute below command line:
    ```sh
    curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
         -X PUT http://restserver/api/job/exampleJob \
         -d @exampleJob.json
    ```

3. Monitor the Job

    Check the list of jobs at:
    ```
    http://restserver/api/job
    ```
    Check your exampleJob status at:
    ```
    http://restserver/api/job/exampleJob
    ```
