## Configuration

Before deploy or maintain pai on your cluster, you should finish configuring the cluster-configuration first.

Note: Don't change the name of the file. And those 4 files should be put in the same directory.


You could find the configuration in this path: [pai/cluster-configuration/][../../cluster-configuration]

## Index

- [cluster-configuration.yaml](#cluster_configuration)
- [k8s-role-definition.yaml](#k8s_role_definition)
- [kubernetes-configuration.yaml](#kubernetes_configuration)
- [serivices-configuration.yaml](#services_configuration)
- [Kubernetes High Availability Configuration](#k8s-high-availability-configuration)

## cluster-configuration.yaml <a name="cluster_configuration"></a>

#### ```default-machine-properties```

```YAML
default-machine-properties:
  # Account with root permission
  username: username
  password: password
  sshport: port
```

In this field, you could set the default value such as username, password and sshport. If those 3 properties is empty in your machine list, paictl will use the default value to ssh to your machine.

Note: The user should be with sudo permission.

#### ```machine-sku```

```YAML
machine-sku:

  NC24R:
    mem: 224
    gpu:
      type: teslak80
      count: 4
    cpu:
      vcore: 24
    #Note: Up to now, the only supported os version is Ubuntu16.04. Please do not change it here.
    os: ubuntu16.04

```

In this field, you could define several sku with different name. And in the machine list you should refer your machine to one of them.

- mem: memory
- gpu: If there is no gpu on this sku, you could remove this field
- os: Now we only supported ubuntu, and pai is only tested on the version 16.04LTS.

#### ```machine-list```

## Kubernetes High Availability Configuration <a name="k8s-high-availability-configuration"></a>

#### ```Deploy Kubernetes With Single Master Node```

Not enable kubernete-ha.

- only set one node's k8s-role as master.
- set this field ```load-balance-ip``` with the value of your master's ip address

#### ```Deploy Kubernetes with ha and deploy proxy through pai```

There are 3 roles in [k8s-role-definition](../../cluster-configuration/k8s-role-definition.yaml). The ```master``` will start k8s-master component on the target machine. And the ```proxy``` will start proxy component on the target machine.

- One or more than one nodes are labeled with ```k8s-role: master```
- One node should be labeled with ```k8s-role: proxy```
- set this field ```load-balance-ip``` with the value of your proxy node's ip address

Node: the proxy node is not in ha mode. If you wanna set proxy in ha-mode, you need customized the role ```proxy```. Or you can create a new role, and create the new rule to deploy k8s on a node.

#### ```Setup k8s-ha iwith the cloud providers's load-balance service```

If your cluster are in the cloud environment such as Azure. You could set the load-balancer through the cloud service.

Before bootstrap your kubernetes cluster, you should configure your load-balance. please set the backend with your master. And set the following property with the ip of the load-balance in the kubernetes-configuration.yaml.

- set the field ```load-balance-ip`` with the ip-address of your cloud load-balancer.
