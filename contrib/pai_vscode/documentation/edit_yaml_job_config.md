## YAML validation

Use [PAI Job Protocol](https://github.com/microsoft/pai/blob/master/docs/pai-job-protocol.yaml) to do the validation for job config file.

### Whitch YAML file is a PAI job config

There's two way to notice the client the YAML file is a PAI job config:

1. File name ends with `.pai.yaml`
2. Contains `protocolVersion: 2` in the YAML root section

The validation will detect errors during your editing, such as:

- Missing property
- Incorrect type
- Duplicate key

## Auto completion

To improve user experience in editing job config file, we provide some code auto completion and generation features:

### 1. Property auto complete

Base on VSCode editor [IntelliSense](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/intellisense) and [YAML extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=redhat.vscode-yaml), user can get suggestions during editing job config.

## Insert OpenPAI Runtime Plugin

OpenPAI support some runtime plugins, such as SSH plugin, Storage plugin and Tensorboard plugin, user can config it in their job and setup the service.
Here is an example of runtime plugin config:

```yaml
extras:
  com.microsoft.pai.runtimeplugin:
    - plugin: ssh
      parameters:
        jobssh: true
    - plugin: teamwise_storage
      parameters:
        storageConfigNames:
          - STORAGE_AZUREBLOB
    - plugin: tensorboard
      parameters:
        port: 11449
        logdir:
          path: /mnt/tensorboard
```

We provide several ways to help user insert the plugin config in YAML file.

### Insert by code snippet

The snippet `OpenPAI Runtime Plugin` will include `"com.microsoft.pai.runtimeplugin:"` line, and will ask user to select the first plugin type and generate it.
Typing `"- plugin:"` will trigger `OpenPAI: Insert a runtime plugin config`, it will help user to add other plugins.
